VR presents new \ninformation; AR distills information from an existing environment. But previous headsets and internet\n-\nenabled glasses haven’t tapped into the potential for either of these in a decision\n-making context. Apple \nis betting that it can b\nuild an ecosystem of app developers who can.\n \nApple announced a new computer last week, to great fanfare. The Vision Pro is a computer that is \nworn on your face, but the novel aspect is how you use it. Rather than view the computer’s output \nthrough a physi\ncal screen, that output is projected directly into your eyes with two very small but \nhigh\n-resolution displays a very small distance in front of you. Rather than control the computer \nthrough a keyboard, mouse, or touch screen, the primary user interface is through eye tracking \nand gestures. \n \nJust as they removed the stylus for screens when they launched the iPhone, Apple requires no \nphysical controller to use the computer. The computer senses what you are interested in \ninteracting with by watching your eye movement and then looks at your hands to determine what \nyou want to do.  \nThere have been antecedents to each of these things — a myriad of worn devices for viewing \nsuch as the Google Glass or Meta’s Quest Pro and technologies such as\n \nLeap Motion\n and the\n \nMyo Armban\nd\n for gesture control. But none of these predecessors put it all together as a coherent \nvision.    \nApple has term\ned this new device\n a spatial compute\nr. The name is apt, because the device can use \nany physical space around you as a canvas to display digital outputs. There is no need for a desk \n(or lap) to place the device, and there are no limits on the size of the pe\nrceived viewing area. That \nmeans you could technically sit in a small space, like an airplane seat, and watch a cinema-\nsized \nmovie.   \nWhat should you be aiming to do with a spatial computer? Right now, Apple has outlined use \ncases that seem pedestrian. You\n can use it like a normal computer or iPad but with the current 2D \ninformation presented on a much more flexible and unconstrained display.

It will be of value where you do not have much space. And it will be of value to those who \ncurrently use their space with a host of large displays. In that sense, the closest analogue is a very \nlarge-\nscreen TV. Would people pay $3,500 for that? They do right now. Even Apple sells a \ndisplay (the Pro Display XDR) that can cost up to $6,000. From t\nhat perspective, it is easily in the \ncost ballpark for current use cases. This strategy also has the benefit of seeding this new platform \nwith the vast number of applications that already exist for the iPad and the iPhone\n.  \nA better and more convenient dis\nplay for 2D content, however, does not appear to justify the \ntechnological and R&D weight that has gone into the Vision Pro. The real question is whether \nthis device can lead to the augmented and virtual reality applications that would justify strapping \na computer to your head. It certainly has the technical capabilities to do so. The Vision Pro can \ndisplay 3D objects in your current space or even transport you to new spaces. Apple, however, \nbarely mentioned the terms AR and VR during their announcement. In doing so, they drew a line \npeople have not drawn before. This is no AR or VR device or technology. The technology is a \nspatial computer, and if there is a role for AR and VR, it is in applications that run on a spatial \ncomputer\n.   \nLet’s review those concepts. Augmented reality (or AR) involves taking the environment around \nyou and changing your perception of it. Google Glass did this by showing you notifications via \nsmart glasses. The Vision Pro does this by placing 2D displays in that environment and fixing \nthem so that when your head moves, the display does not. It appears to be there in your current \nenvironment. This is achieved by passing a very accurate video of the real world through the \ndevice to you. You don’t see your environment directly, but you t\nhink you are doing so. Thus, \ntechnically, Apple is augmenting a video capture of your environment, not overlaying things on \nyour direct viewing of it. To a user, there’s no real difference.\n    \nVirtual reality (or VR) involves taking the user and immersing them in a virtual environment. \nThe Vision Pro captures the full attention of your eye, and so you are, by definition, immersed in \na virtual environment. In one mode, that looks like the environment you are actually in. Turn the \ndial, and that can change, an\nd you can be transported somewhere else. The video pass\n-through \nfrom your current environment is replaced by a digitally created 3D environment. From that \nperspective, this is clearly a VR device.\n    \nThe important thing to note is that despite being capable\n of AR and VR, these use\n-cases were not \nemphasized by Apple. Thus, they have produced a device capable of both but have not found \ncompelling use cases in either domain. This is one of the reasons that they announced it at their \nannual developer conference.\n Apple needs apps, and they need other people to imagine them\n.  \nIn a\n \nrecent paper\n, we outlined what we believed were the ways that AR and VR apps could add \nunique value. Beyond gaming and entertainment, our focus is on economic uses — specifically, \nthose that would increase users’ productivity. In this respect, we ask: Which AR and VR \napplications can create real value by assisting users in making better decisions? For someone \nlooking to build applications for the platform Apple has created, understanding the possibilities is \ncrucial.\n    \nMost decisions involve some degree of uncertainty. Information is the cure for that, allowing you \nto know more and, therefore, make fewer errors.

Second, you need to have the \ncognitive space to distill and parse that information for usefulness\n.   \nAs it turns out, AR and VR map into each of these things. VR has the\n ability to present the user \nwith more relevant information, especially when that information is either not with them or is \ncostly to acquire. By immersing users in new contexts, what it does is bring that information to \nthem. In some cases, it may be a realistic view of what is going on inside a building, say, during a \nfire. In other cases, it presents a safe, simulated environment, such as a flight simulator that \nfacilitates training without the high stakes\n.   \nBy contrast, AR takes information presented in a given context and parses it to yield the \ninformation that is relevant. For instance, when you meet someone at a conference, it provides \nidentification of who that person is without you having to search your own memory. Or, it can \nprovide a helpful overl\nay with exit routes if you are dealing with a fire. In each case, the goal is \nto distill the quantity of information from the user’s environment and present the information that \nis needed. The one thing to note is that the Vision Pro is not meant to be a portable computer to \nbe used outside of the home or the workplace, which limits its applicability in navigating external \nenvironments (such as while driving)\n.   \nThis perspective highlights why many previous AR and VR purported use cases have been of low \nvalu\ne. VR meetings with avatars in pretty rooms do not provide information that is obviously \nmore useful to those in the meetings that might arise from a Zoom call. AR glasses that provide \ntext notifications as you walk around are increasing your cognitive loa\nd rather than decreasing it. \nOur framework suggests that the best use cases will be in contexts where it is normally expensive \nor dangerous to get information, highlighting the value of VR, or where the environment is so \ncomplex that the value of digital o\nverlays to clarify it via AR is high\n — or both. Think \napplications like prototyping the design of a new aircraft or building, or assisting in remote \nmedical procedures. The Vision Pro exhibits capabilities of being able to do each of these things \nbut the j\nob of experimenting and designing for these use cases has been left to others. Developers \nlooking to profit off the platform Apple has created would do well to focus on applications that \nprovide users with hard-\nto-access contextual information at just the right level of detail. \n \nThis is par for the course for Apple when they first introduce a device. The iPod was a digital \nwalkman. The iPhone was a connected iPod. The iPad was a bigger iPhone. The Apple Watch \nwas a better smartwatch. And the Vision Pro is a\nn unconstrained 3D screen. In the previous \ncases, the device is outgrown and becomes more than that initial use by enabling developer \ninnovation. The Vision Pro is a welcome ne\nw experi\nmen\nt along a well\n-trodden path in \ncomputing\n.","metadata":{"source":"./embeddings_source/VisionPro.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.6","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Title":"","Author":"Secret","Creator":"Acrobat PDFMaker 20 for Word","Producer":"Adobe PDF Library 20.6.66","CreationDate":"D:20230629124937+02'00'","ModDate":"D:20230629124939+02'00'"},"metadata":{"_metadata":{"xmp:modifydate":"2023-06-29T12:49:39+02:00","xmp:createdate":"2023-06-29T12:49:37+02:00","xmp:metadatadate":"2023-06-29T12:49:39+02:00","xmp:creatortool":"Acrobat PDFMaker 20 for Word","xmpmm:documentid":"uuid:01870b74-8a54-4adc-8753-81b8f6e1b812","xmpmm:instanceid":"uuid:562adc92-74fd-4554-b920-401e7ba5b9f6","xmpmm:subject":"2","dc:format":"application/pdf","dc:title":"","dc:creator":"Secret","pdf:producer":"Adobe PDF Library 20.6.66","pdfx:sourcemodified":"D:20230629104914","pdfx:company":""}},"totalPages":9},"loc":{"pageNumber":9,"lines":{"from":1,"to":52}}}}]],{"0":"0f5e04a2-3be4-49b9-a7b8-16957ca1d7ed","1":"1ae9ba13-3c28-4f7d-a820-cccc6148a7e1","2":"64a2dd29-a9c4-4cfc-a4ec-2c5a3476ce59","3":"0bb72b0b-6d08-4799-8a73-849d9b43304b","4":"5b699b5c-6f09-4d62-9382-241b624259f7","5":"6614d21c-4bbf-4fd6-a2cb-5ebf023e1320","6":"c4d3303b-cec2-47df-b553-ef214c5e55cf","7":"0df739e8-2cee-4a0e-ad65-fb0f2b2123bc","8":"5c0b576b-1a63-4937-b2cc-ab2c2b13be1a"}]
